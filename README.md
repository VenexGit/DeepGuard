  This is a public collection of domains that anyone can help to expand.  
I am mainly concerned with such lists, which do not yet exist or are very rare.  

If you have problems with any of these services, you are welcome to open an issue or make changes with a pull request!

## Support

Maintaining a quality blocking project takes a lot of time. GoodbyeAds is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend our owns to pay the bills. This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent improving GoodbyeAds rather than dealing with distractions.

This donation is for our services, not for any pack, resource or any other mean. Your support will help us keep the project running and provide you quality service.
